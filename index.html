              The Doomsday Algorithm, devised by mathematician John Horton
              Conway, is a fascinating method for determining the day of the
              week for any given date. It's a nifty tool that combines
              mathematical precision with a touch of historical curiosity,
              making it both a practical and intellectually stimulating
              exercise.

            <h3 class="mt-3">Understanding the Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
              The core idea behind the Doomsday Algorithm is that each year has
              a "Doomsday" — a specific day of the week that certain dates fall
              on. Once you know the Doomsday for a given year, you can easily
              calculate the day of the week for any date in that year. The
              algorithm consists of a few steps:
            </p>

            <br />
            <h3>Anchor Day Calculation:</h3>
            <p>
              This is the day of the week for a known Doomsday in a given
              century. For example, the anchor day for the 1900s is Wednesday,
              and for the 2000s, it's Tuesday. Yearly Doomsday Calculation:
              Calculate the Doomsday for the specific year. This involves:
              Taking the last two digits of the year. Adding the number of times
              12 fits into those digits. Adding the quotient obtained by
              dividing the remainder from the previous step by 4. Summing these
              results and taking the modulus 7 of the sum. Determine the Closest
              Doomsday: Find a date in the same year that falls on the Doomsday.
              Notable Doomsdays include: 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12. For
              non-leap years: 1/3, 2/28, 3/14, 5/9, 7/11, 9/5, and 11/7. For
              leap years: 1/4 and 2/29. Calculate the Target Date: Use the known
              Doomsday and the difference in days to determine the day of the
              week for the desired date. Example Calculation Let's determine the
              day of the week for July 4, 2024. Anchor Day for the 2000s:
              Tuesday. Yearly Doomsday Calculation: Last two digits of the year:
              24. How many times 12 fits into 24: 24 12 = 2 12 24 ​ =2.
              Remainder: 24 m o d     12 = 0 24mod12=0. How many times 4 fits
              into 0: 0 4 = 0 4 0 ​ =0. Sum: 24 + 2 + 0 = 26 24+2+0=26. Modulus
              7: 26 m o d     7 = 5 26mod7=5. Therefore, the Doomsday for 2024
              is 5 days after Tuesday, which is Sunday. Closest Doomsday to July
              4: In a leap year like 2024, July 11 is a Doomsday. Calculate the
              Target Date: July 11, 2024, is a Sunday. July 4 is 7 days before
              July 11. Since 7 days before Sunday is also Sunday. So, July 4,
              2024, is a Sunday.

            <h3>Applications and Fun Facts</h3>
            <p>
              The Doomsday Algorithm isn't just a mathematical curiosity; it has
              practical applications, such as in calendar design and event
              planning. It's also a popular party trick for impressing friends
              with your ability to quickly calculate the day of the week for any
              date. John Horton Conway, who created the algorithm, was a
              renowned mathematician known for his work in group theory, number
              theory, and the creation of the cellular automaton called the Game
              of Life. His contributions to recreational mathematics have made
              complex concepts accessible and enjoyable for a broad audience. In
              summary, the Doomsday Algorithm is a brilliant example of how
              mathematical patterns can be applied to everyday problems, turning
              the abstract into the practical and the complex into the
              manageable. Whether you're a math enthusiast or just curious, it's
              a fun and useful tool to have in your mental toolbox.
